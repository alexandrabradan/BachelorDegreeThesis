# Lastfm Leader detection and Hit-Savvy prediction

Here you can find my work done during my internship at University of Pisa. The aim of the internship was to validate the leader detection algorithm and the forecast model **Hits&Flops** tuned-up by the Knowledge Discovery Data Mining Laboratory(KDD Lab), the joint research initiative of ISTI Insitute of CNR and the Departement of Computer Science of the University of Pisa. The leader detection algorithm and the forecast model can be found at the following links:

The validation was made using a dataset of users collected from the Last.fm platform, a music website similar to Spotify, but capable to function like a personal musical museum ("Here's everything that I listened to!") based in part on competition ("Look how much I listened to!") and recognition ("You listen to what I listen to, so we're compatible"â€”there is even a compatibility meter that ranks how much you have in common with other users). Using a music recommender system called "Audioscrobbler", Last.fm builds a detailed profile of each user's musical taste by recording details of the tracks the user listens to, either from Internet radio stations, or the user's computer or many portable music devices. This information is transferred ("scrobbled") to Last.fm's database either via the music player itself (including, among others Spotify, Deezer, Tidal, and MusicBee) or via a plug-in installed into the user's music player. The data is then displayed on the user's profile page and compiled to create reference pages for individual artists. That way, even if a user'd ripped the demo of a local band, another user could find other people who'd also listened to them through the artist's dedicated page and discover other potential bands or artists alike. 

After the validation (which encountered the expected output) I embark in a predictive model for ...

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

```
Give examples
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo
