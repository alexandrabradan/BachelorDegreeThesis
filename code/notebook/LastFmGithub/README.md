# Lastfm Leader detection and Hit-Savvy prediction

Here you can find my work done during my internship at University of Pisa. The aim of the internship was to find similarities among the leader detection algorithm and the forecast model **Hits&Flops** tuned-up by the Knowledge Discovery Data Mining Laboratory(KDD Lab), the joint research initiative of ISTI Insitute of CNR and the Departement of Computer Science of the University of Pisa. The original leader detection algorithm and forecast model can be found at the following links:

The data and results are still missing, I'm apologizing. I'll upload when I'll have a bit of free time :)
