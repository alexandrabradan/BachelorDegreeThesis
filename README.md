# Lastfm Leader detection and Hit-Savvy prediction

Here you can find the work that I've done during my internship at University of Pisa. The aim of the internship was to use a leader detection algorithm combined with a predictive model, to validate the following question:

*"Can we exploit influential nodes in a music network to predicte the success of new, succesfull artists?"*

My study showed how in a sparse network (low friendship density and fragmentary adoption log) influential and predictive nodes are uncorrelated (if a node is able to influence with his adoptions his peer neighbors, most of the time he is not useful to spot success. The same is true for nodes used as indicators to measure unseen artists' future success or not, which in most cases aren't influential for their friends). Lastly, my work confirms nodes' preferntial attachment using a Personal Listening Model, which in part explains the sparsity of the analyzed newtork.
